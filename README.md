Some Python solutions (my prototyping solution)

### Things to do. 

Probably just prototype everything in Python.
> Is using `numpy` cheating...

Rewrite everything in Haskell (so you can think about the program as a data transform and think about the algorithm) 

Rewrite everything in C (so you think about every step executing and how to minimise the number of steps)
